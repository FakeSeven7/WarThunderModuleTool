## Notes:

1、Before use, please ensure your model is sourced from gamemodels3d.com and that the model file (obj) and texture folder are in the same directory.

2、After clearing the scene, select the newly created workgroup, then import the model obj with the "Split By Group" option checked. Subsequent operations will only affect objects within this group. If you have objects you wish to keep, you can move them out of the workgroup.
